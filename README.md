This repo contains a time series analysis on the temperature trend from 1659 to 2019. The data used here is the [Central England Temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_England_temperature) dataset, which is the longest instrumental record of temperature in the world. <br>
In the report, an exploratory data analysis of the temperature trend is performed through different smoothing method, and a statistical model (SARIMA) is fitted along with justifications through diagnostic plots and AIC/BIC. <br>
The analysis also seeks to answer the question of whether the global warming is slowing down in the 2000's, which is discussed in this [article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/did-global-warming-slow-down-in-the-2000s-or-not/).
